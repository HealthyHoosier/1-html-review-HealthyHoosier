            <h1>What is an Exploit?</h1>
            <p>
                From a cyber security perspective, and exploit is any function, feature, or vulnerability that allows an attacker
                to successfully perform an attack, escalate priviledge, or access otherwise hidden content. Exploits exist in nearly every facet
                of computing and Bootsy has done extensive research into the topics of exploits and vulnerabilities.

            <!--Don't Worry its not a real book. I'm making most of this up from my memory. The excerpt is about how humans are often the most exploited in computer systems-->
            <p>
                The following is an excerpt from Bootsy's latest novel <i>Collars to Computing... a Dangerous World</i>.
                It has been translated from his native dog tongue, into english.

                <p><i>
                    "It seems as though, in this modern age of computing, nearly everything can be exploited.
                    They used to call a dog man's best friend, however now it appears computers have replaced
                    our roles. Cellphones in every pocket seem to get more and more of the human's attention. Yet in most 
                    computer systems, it is this very human element which gets exploited most. They are their own vice
                    to their creation. Whether it be tailgaiting, phishing, or my favorite, dumpster-diving, the human
                    element still remains to be the most exploited aspect of most computer systems..."
                </i></p>

            <br>
            <p>
                Here Bootsy provides an interesting perspective that humans, and the human element, are often the most
                exploited when it comes to computer systems. An answer not many may have expected, but it serves as a harsh
                reality of most computer systems. Most vulnerabilities arise from misconfigurations or human error.
                Perhaps the most redeeming quality of cyber security is that it does not take a "computer genius". Most
                issues stem from human-made mistakes. A keen eye and an inquisitve mind is all the cyber investigator needs.
